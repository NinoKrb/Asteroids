# Asteroids Animation
This Python script was developed for a school assignment. It was about doing a small PyGame replay. For this we started to rebuild the old arcade game Asteroids. It is programmed in partial steps, so that every lesson a part of the game is extended.

# Keybinds
These are the key combinations for controlling the spaceship.

[W] - Accelerate
